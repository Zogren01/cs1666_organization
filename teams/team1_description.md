They will need to navigate through different rooms and face various advanced enemies in order to find an reach the ending. 

The screen size for the game will be 800x400.

Items the player will have available:
* double jump ability
* projectile attack
* vanishing move (temporarily invisible to enemies)
* extra time
* extra health
* extra damage

## Advanced Topic Description

### ADVTOPIC1 -- Physics

The physics of the game world will function like a 2D simulation of the real world. The game will feature accurate rigid body colllisions between movable objects. There will be breakable objects found in the game world that will further showcase the use of these equations.
    
### ADVTOPIC2 -- Enemy AI

The game will consist of at least 3 different enemy types, that all have distinctly different behavior. These 3 types will be:
	- basic melee enemy that aggressively pushes to and attempts to beat player
	- ranged enemy that seeks to keep distance and contintinually damage player
	- hunter enemy that is less aggressive and seeks to attack player when they are preoccupied or vulnerable


## Midterm Goals

* The basic layout of map will have been created, along with some of the rooms the player can explore
* The player is able to move through this world and use attacks
* Game timer will be functioning, and reset the player when it runs out
* Item store will be set up (no items needed yet)
* At least one type of enemy AI will exist and be able to challenge the player

## Final Goals

* 15%: Rigid body collisions
* 10%: Breakable objects
* 35%: at least 3 distinct enemy types with advanced movement and decisionmaking
* 20%: at least 3 unique items created and accessible to the player to change their abilities and gameplay (not including extra time/health/damage)
* 10%: Reaching MVP

## Stretch Goals

* 5%: Stretch goal 1 -- boss battle
* 5%: Stretch goal 2 -- jetpack item available and additional levels in the game
